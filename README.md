# Philosophy_Opinion_Flow-Chart
My personal philosophy on opinions, designed to drive correct philosophy about approach.

Designed so that the first diamond has any opinion that is REQUIRED for ethical/correct action.

Beliefs about how to act must be adequately justified. If there is no harm caused by a particular opinion, then it is already justified.

The loop is required to sustain an individual in the thought process required to exact an opinion. Some may leave early upon finding supporting evidence.

This can cause issues if in some cases, harmful ignorance(whether intentional or not), causes the opinion in question to be a supporting opinion(evidence), and the opinion still requires further justification(like if there reason that it should definitely not be the opinion you should support opinions with, pros vs cons... put simply.).

The flowchart takes into account, while you may have the truth, you may not know if the truth is true.

The last section, was suposed to be a bit tongue in cheek... it actually represents a section for opinions that are evident to be correct. The new opinions may or may not be useful, and its a bit of a brainstorm method, the supported opinions do not nescessarily need to be true, as they may not have undergone correct analysis.

Of course, while some of the pieces of the information, might seem fallible in truth(and they very well could be). I tried my best to keep the opinion that was created in the first instance to be the opinion that is proved.

# I do not actually know if i can obtain cake, the opinion could be wrong, although it could be useful, i might NOT try to obtain cake IF i think i cannot.

    - On further analysis, the question should not be whether you CAN obtain cake. but whether you should try to obtain cake...

    - It IS likely that you will obtain cake, even if the universe could leave the very room in an instant, it usually doesnt.

If you decide that any of the supported opinions are in fact, not well supported by what is shown on the flow chart, more evidence may be required.


# At the end of the day, are the goals of your opinions justified?
    - You may find if you purposely do the wrong thing, it will end you in shit.
